## Approach

Smart Recipe Generator uses AI-powered image recognition and natural language
generation to help users discover recipes from ingredients they already have.

**Architecture:** Built with Next.js 16 (App Router + Turbopack) for
server-rendered performance, shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS for a clean responsive UI,
and Firebase Firestore for real-time data storage. The Vercel AI SDK 6 abstracts
AI provider calls, making it easy to swap models.

**Ingredient Recognition:** Users upload a photo of their ingredients. The image
is sent to Gemini 3 Flash via `generateObject()`, which returns a structured
list of detected ingredients with confidence scores.

**Recipe Generation:** The app combines a seeded Firestore database of 23 curated
recipes with AI-generated recipes using `streamObject()` for real-time streaming.
Each recipe includes nutrition info, step-by-step instructions, and substitution
suggestions.

**Personalization:** User ratings and favorites are stored per-user in Firestore.
A suggestions API analyzes rating patterns to recommend similar recipes.
